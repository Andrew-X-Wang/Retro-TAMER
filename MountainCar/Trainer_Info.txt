There one was a man named Osman, who really wanted to have James Cameron cry 800 years layter, and so, he found the Ottoman Empire.

Mountain Car: The goal of this agent is to reach the flag at the top right by rocking back and forth along the track. 
	Your goal as the trainer is to help the agent achieve its goal by providing positive and negative feedback on its actions. 
You will be able to see where the agent is and its velocity; on the terminal you will also see which direction the agent will be accelerating in
(left, right, or still). 
You can press the left key if the agent is not making the right decision, or the right key if the agent is making the right decision.
Each individual training session ends when the car reaches the flag. You can choose to continue training (if you can find it within yourself,
at least 3 sessions would be great :)) or you can end. Please enter your name before finishing.


For Retro-TAMER, after each time the car reaches the flag, you will also be given a playback of the training session you just went through. You
can press the up key to progress through the training one frame at a time, and assign additional feedback at the exact points of interest.
