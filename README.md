# Retro-TAMER
Retroactive Feedback Assignment within the TAMER Framework

@TODO:
  - Choosing a domain for Tetris
    - Interested in: state representation
  - Candidate: OpenAI Gym Tetris
  
  - Can we build TAMER off of the state-action representation and environment? Can we map visuals to a particular state in the state-action space?
